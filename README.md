# Antd custom theme generator

A simple way to create an antd theme css file with zero configuration.

[Ant Design](https://ant.design/) provides plenty of UI components, styled with [less](http://lesscss.org/).
You can customize the default theme modifying less variables, [check the doc](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme) for multiple ways to achieve this.\
The main issue being that you don't have a simple way to create a static `css` file with zero configuration.

This package was created with `Antd Design v4.6.6` and aims to ease the theme's customization process without having to install more dependencies yourself, set up `less` or eject your [React](reactjs.org) project.

## Usage

### Generate custom theme styles

1. Create your own custom theme overriding Antd's less variables (by default: `./custom-theme.less`).

2. Generate theme's custom `.css` file.

  - **Option A:** Without installing this plugin:
    ```sh
    $ npx @emeks/antd-custom-theme-generator

    output > ./custom-theme.css
    ```

  - **Option B:** Installing the package as a dev dependency:

    ```sh
    $ npm i -E --save-dev @emeks/antd-custom-theme-generator
    ```

    Then generating your theme:
    ```sh
    $ generate-theme

    output > ./custom-theme.css
    ```

3. Replace `antd/dist/antd.css` import in your project, with the output file (by default: `./custom-theme.css`) generated by this plugin.

### Options

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--verbose` or `-v` | | Print more info for debugging |
| `--antd` | ./node_modules/antd | Path of the antd library |
| `--theme` | default | Antd theme you want to override (e.g. `dark` or `compact`) - [Check available options](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/tree/master/components/style/themes). |
| `<customThemeFilePath>` | ./custom-theme.less | Path of the less file with the variables your want to override |
| `<generatedThemeFilePath>` | ./custom-theme.css | Output path where the script give you the css file with your new theme |

> **Notes**:
>
> The order of the paths **is** important.
>  ```sh
>  $ generate-theme [--verbose] [--antd] [--theme] [<customThemeFilePath>] [<generatedThemeFilePath>]
>  ```
>

### Examples

- Generate dark theme

  ```sh
  $ npx @emeks/antd-custom-theme-generator --theme dark
  ```

- Generate default theme with non default paths
  ```sh
  $ npx @emeks/antd-custom-theme-generator ./styles/custom-theme.less ./styles/custom-theme.css
  ```

### FAQ

> **Q1: Which variables can I override?**

You may override any variable exposed by Antd in [this file](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/master/components/style/themes/default.less).

> **Q2: Should I run this command every time I change my `custom-theme.less` file?**

Yes, we don't provide hot-reload yet.

## Development

- Inside package folder, link it globally:

```sh
$ npm link
```

- Use the package in your project (with antd already installed and a `custom-theme.less` file created as well):

```sh
$ generate-theme
```

## TODO List:

- [ ] Add hot-reload generation.
