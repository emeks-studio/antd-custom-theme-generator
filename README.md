# Antd custom theme generator

A simple way to create an antd theme css file with zero configuration.

[Ant Design](https://ant.design/) provides plenty of UI components, styled with [less](http://lesscss.org/). You can customize the default theme modifying less variable, to achive this you have multiple ways ([check the doc here](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme)). The problem is that you don't have a simple way to create a static `css` file with zero configuration.

This project was created with `Antd Design v4.6.6` and aims to simplify the customization of your theme if you don't want to install dependencies, configurate things like `less` or eject your [React](reactjs.org) project.

## Usage

### Generate custom theme styles

1. Create your own custom theme with the variables that you want to override, in a file called `./custom-theme.less`.

2. To generate the `css` file with your custom theme, run this command:

   - **Option A:** Without installing this plugin

     ```sh
     $ npx @emeks/antd-custom-theme-generator

     output > ./custom-theme.css
     ```

   - **Option B:** Installing the package as a dev dependency

     ```sh
     $ npm i -E --save-dev @emeks/antd-custom-theme-generator
     ```

     Then generates your custom theme:

     ```sh
     $ generate-theme

     output > ./custom-theme.css
     ```

3. Replace the import of `antd/dist/antd.css` in your project, with the output file (`custom-theme.css`) generated by this plugin.

### FAQ

**Q1: Which variables can I override?**

> The variables that are exposed by antd in this file: https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/master/components/style/themes/default.less

**Q2: Should I run this command every time i change my `custom-theme.less` file?**

> Yes, we don't provide hot-reload yet.

## Development

### Use the package locally:

```sh
$ npm link
```

Then in another project with antd already installed and with a `custom-theme.less` file created, execute:

```sh
$ generate-theme
```

## TODO List:

- [ ] Add hot-reload generation
